INTRODUCTION
------------
The mildly practical content queueing system for your browser. A Chrome extension still very early in development. Now plays unprotected Youtube content!

VERSION
------------
####v0.6
Soundcloud support has begun! The API hasn't been fully hooked up yet, so you have to skip the track to go to the next bit of content.

We also fully implemented video removal via a double-click, but sadly, Chrome's horrific permissions prevent our code from running. We're trying to make our solution not in-line, as that should fix it, but that's not easy for dynamic content.

####v0.5
Major bug fixes! We've switched storage solutions to Rhaboo.js, and now the majority of the functionality works fine. Let us know if you have any problems!

INSTALLATION
------------
  1. Download the code from here
  2. Navigate chrome to `chrome://extensions`
  3. Check the `Developer mode` toggle
  4. Click on `Load Unpacked Extension...`
  5. Select the folder containing the extension
